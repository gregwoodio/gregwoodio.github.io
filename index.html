    <h1>Greg Wood</h1>
    <p><i>Portfolio & Oddities</i></p>

    <p>
        Hi, I'm Greg Wood. I write code and walk dogs. You've found my portfolio of sorts! These are projects I probably
        worked on for a weekend or so then forgot about. I'm not sure they're completely representative of my abilities
        as a developer, but I had fun making them and I hope that you have fun poking around here. There's more code at
        my <a href="https://github.com/gregwoodio" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and a sporadically updated blog <a
            href="https://gregwoodio.bearblog.dev/blog/" target="_blank">here.</a>
    </p>

    <h2>Flutter</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="./fridge-poetry/index.html" target="_blank">Fridge poetry</a> (2022) - I put together this project
            while learning to use <code>Draggables</code>. There's also a <a
                href="https://gregwoodio.bearblog.dev/fridge-poetry-in-flutter/" target="_blank">blog post</a> about it.
            <a href="https://github.com/gregwoodio/fridge_poetry" target="_blank">code</a>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Web</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="https://www.simracingforthekids.com/" target="_blank">Sim Racing for the Kids</a> (2022-present) - Website for an annual charity Sim Racing event.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Games</h2>
    <p>I'm not much of a gamedev, but I've played around with some simple toolkits and made the following:</p>

    <h3>Pico-8</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="./minesweeper/minesweeper.html" target="_blank">Minesweeper</a> (2020) - The classic Windows game.
            <a href="https://github.com/gregwoodio/minesweeper_p8" target="_blank">code</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="./picross/picross.html" target="_blank">Picross</a> (2020) - Honestly not the best. If I remember
            right it just cjooses random squares rather than actually drawing a picture. If you like that then this is
            the game for you! <a href="https://github.com/gregwoodio/picross_p8" target="_blank">code</a>
        <li>
            <a href="./snake/snake.html" target="_blank">Snake</a> (2018) - I have very fond memories of playing Snake
            on my mom's old Nokia cell phone while waiting for my brother to finish after-school extracurriculars. Here
            it is recreated for the Pico-8 fantasy console. <a href="https://github.com/gregwoodio/snake_p8">code</a>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>PuzzleScript</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="./a_good_snowman/a_good_snowman.html" target="_blank">A Puzzling Snowman is Hard to Build</a>
            (2021?) - Inspired by the game <em>A Good Snowman is Hard to Build</em> by Alan Hazelden & Benjamin Davis.
            It's a Sokoban/pushing block puzzle game where you need to stack three snowballs of increasing size to build
            a snowman. If you don't have the right size snowballs then you can push a smaller one through a patch of
            snow to make it bigger. PuzzleScript is very graphically limited which makes this a bit hard to play, but
            once you start to recognize each game piece it's actually a pretty fun game.
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="./colourmancer/Colourmancer.html" target="_blank">Colourmancer</a> (2021?) - Yes there's a 'u' in
            it. Guide your wizard through the mazes by pushing keys to locks in order to raise and lower magical walls.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Javascript</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="./helicopter/helicopter.html" target="_blank">Helicopter</a> (2016) - Fly your helicopter through a
            windy, increasingly narrow cave (like you do). Try not to get motion sick! <a
                href="https://github.com/gregwoodio/helicopter" target="_blank">code</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
